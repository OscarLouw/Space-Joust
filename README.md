# Space-Joust
A top down space physics brawler game. Single player or couch multiplayer.
I'm making this for my Game Engine Programming subject at University.

I'm keeping the project relatively low in scope to make sure I can finish it easily.
Here are the features I have planned:
 - Full physics based weapon system
   => Fast paced space fencing action
   => Multiple weapons: plasma sword, flail, crossbow, shield, etc
 - Destructible space props including asteroids, explosives, crates, etc
 - Controller support
 - PvE and PvP modes
   => Single player survival against an endless onslaught of enemies
   => Multipler couch versus (up to 4 controllers)
   => Multiplayer couch co-op survival (up to 4 controllers)
 - Multiple enemy types: Kamikaze drones, laser drones, beam drones, sword drones
 - Projectile deflection
 - Different player skills: Dash, shield, damage, growth
 - Power-ups

Should be fun! Hope I can get it all done :)
